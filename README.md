# AGRO SMART

A digital system which offers detection of diseases in plant leaves through extensive image processing techniques and Advanced machine learning algorithms

The user may effectively determine the disease caused by a specific microorganism on a plant leaf by using the Fuzzy Inference technique. It also successfully displays the predicted health severity of the leaf based on the percentage of the leaf that is infected.

# METHODOLOGY ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1.    Neural Network Algorithm 

After analysing the various dataset photos, the deep learning algorithm divides the images into five categories: fungi, viruses, bacteria, nematodes, and normal leaves (not at all affected).

Following feature classification, the diseased leaf's features were extracted using a digital image processing technique.

# 2.    Image processing Techniques

examined the photos in the collection to comprehend the various ways that the organisms infect the leaves. Therefore, the primary goal of the image processing technique is to isolate the leaf's green portion and isolate the leaf's diseased area. This would enable us to draw attention to the contaminated area alone.

# 3. Fuzzy interface system

Lastly, following feature extraction, a set of rules was aggregated using MATLAB's Fuzzy Inference System to calculate the leaf's health severity as a percentage.
